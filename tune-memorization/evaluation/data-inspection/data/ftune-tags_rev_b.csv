Collections usually don't include nested JSON objects if those information can be requested from the individual resources. ## Web Linking The API is designed in a way that to most entities (e.g. collections and processes) a set of links can be added. These can be alternate representations, e.g. data discovery via OGC WCS or OGC CSW, references to a license, references to actual raw data for downloading, detailed information about pre-processing and more. Clients should allow users to follow the links. Whenever links are utilized in the API, the description explains which relation (`rel` property) types are commonly used.
